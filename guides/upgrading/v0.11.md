# Upgrading to v0.11

## Parameter changes in core modules

In case you are using `Backpex.Resource` or one of the `Backpex.Adapter` modules (`Backpex.Adapters.Ecto` or
`Backpex.Adapters.Ash`) directly check out the updated function definitions. This will also apply in case you built your
own adapter.
