# Upgrading to v0.11

## Bump Your Deps

Update Backpex to the latest version:

```elixir
  defp deps do
    [
      {:backpex, "~> 0.11.0"}
    ]
  end
```

## Parameter changes in core modules

In case you are using `Backpex.Resource` or one of the `Backpex.Adapter` modules (`Backpex.Adapters.Ecto` or
`Backpex.Adapters.Ash`) directly check out the updated function definitions. This will also apply in case you built your
own adapter.

## Make sure to cover all cases with the `item_query/3` function

We have removed code that ensures that a fallback item query function is always added to your LiveResource. 

Make sure to always cover all possible cases or add a fallback `item_query/3` function that just returns the query.

For example:

```elixir
# in your resource configuration file (live resource)
use Backpex.LiveResource,
  # ...other options
  adapter_config: [
    # ...other adapter options
    item_query: &__MODULE__.item_query/3
  ]

  def item_query(query, :index, _assigns) do
    query
    |> where([post], post.published)
  end

  # make sure to add this fallback function
  def item_query(query, _live_action, _assigns) do
    query
  end
```

## We removed `Ecto.Query` import from LiveResource

Previously, we automatically imported `Ecto.Query` into LiveResources. We removed this behavior,
so you need to import it yourself if you need it, e.g. for the `item_query/3` callback.

## PubSub config is now optional

You can safely remove the pubsub configuration from your LiveResources:

```elixir
    pubsub: [
        name: Demo.PubSub
        topic: "posts",
        event_prefix: "post_"
    ]
```

In order to make it work, you need to set your PubSub server in your config:

```elixir
config :backpex, :pubsub_server, MyApp.PubSub
```

In case you still want to overwrite the settings, the `name` option is now called `server`.
